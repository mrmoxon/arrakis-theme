#### I. The Story of Life

It is one thing to exist, and another thing to philosophise about it. 

To start from the basics, living matter arose from non-living matter between 3.5 and 4.3 billion years ago, soon-after the formation of oceans on planet Earth. We have no consensus over how, but the strongest hypothesis suggests a gradual process involving (1) autocatalytic reactions, (2) molecular self-replication, (3) molecular self-assembly, and (4) the emergence of cell membranes.  

Broadly speaking, life has two properties: 'survival' (metabolism and self-repair) and replication. All living organisms regenerate in accordance to their suitability to these parameters, thus possessing a 'fitness function' by nature. This regenerative process is Darwinian evolution. This function is synonymous to life as we know it, and is even what NASA use to define it "a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution". 

The power of this theory supplants other explanations. It states that for all species of organism, the reproductive process generates small variations in offspring, causing them to develop into 'fitter' species, more capable of surviving and reproducing in their environment. An organism's fitness determines its ability to produce offspring, and thus the process is cyclical; survival is granted only to those most fit. 

In 3 billion years, life advanced incrementally from single-celled (bacteria) to multi-cellular (plants, fungi) to protostomes and echinoderms, then fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and eventually mammals. This endless process of speciation is caused by species members being exposed to new conditions that impact their chance of survival.

Fitness scores are applicable to any genomic process, which means almost anything can be framed as an evolutionary problem. Genetic algorithms can approximate anything from  travelling salesmen to the solutions in your Gold Olympiad paper. When running evolution on static problems like these, the majority of progress is made in the first few epochs --- but in the wild, progress comes in bursts; freak mutations (like the first nervous system or cortical column)  new vectors of growth and create a series of cabrianesque explosions, consisting of predatory arms races, new environments to explore and adapt to, and an influx of diversity in the gene pool.

On a micro scale, the observation that inspired Darwin's theory was the shape of finches' beaks in the Galapagos. For a given beak size and shape, the original species of immigrant finch landing on the islands would only be able to exploit a share of a fixed food pool. Therefore, the fittest individuals would find creative sources of nutrients by probing into bark crevices or by navigating the spines of a cactus. At a catatonic pace, the finches then tailored their dances, songs, and biology, to the diet that suited them best.

It wasn't until 100 years after the publishing of Darwin's theory, that the biological evidence was discovered by Watson, Crick and Franklin, in 1953. 'DNA' gives us the reductionist story of life itself. In Crick's work, he states that "All approaches at a higher level are suspect until confirmed at the molecular level".

But the plot thickens. As animals evolve, and their ability to generate and process information from their environments become more complex, a degree of 'wakingness' is produced. Some organisms become so complex that they not only can see their environment, but can feel it, hear it, smell it, and taste it. And not only that, but they can recognise patterns, make predictions, and plan ahead. Given sufficient generations, some mammals become so capable of thinking that they can cooperate in large groups, build tools, and 'solve' their environment to suit their needs by growing food on-command for more efficient survival. 

Ultimately, hydrogen, in the right conditions, becomes self-aware.

The axioms of biology

Substrate independence

Inputs/Outputs: inputs are large, outputs are limited to a biological bandwidth the sum of our voice, hand guestures, and facial expressions and very little else. (dance, ) - they are multidimensional, because voice can pack loads of information by theh context and delivery. And behaviour is also heavily multidimensional. 

At the society level, we can model a country of people as an agent with millions of inputs and outputs. At some point the number of outputs grows equivalent to the inputs; they are processed and transformed at an equal rate. 

The axiom of consciousness is really just abstractions, which are converted into computations, which are accumulated in large systems. 
The brain system is messy and unstructured; we cannot influence it particularly.

But we can try: first by adding more neurons and growing the mass. Then by manipulating it to optimise the quality of computations. This is the advantage of computers. 







The goal is to bridge across and transmit our conscious experience, identity, ego, into another more transmittable medium. Neurons have a lifespan and denature or become more vulnerable to diseases that are likely to destroy parts of the brain. 

The key is transmitting this without sacrifing the ways we update; hence the learning process is key to understand. We use action potentials to weaken and harden some synaptic connections in a process called: long term potentiation/depression. This process is unique to us, and different to the algorithms we are training. 

It is important that we learn this recipe before 



#### II. Understanding Substrate-Independence

DNA gave us a biological building block to use as a lens to view all life. But the punchline seems rather feeble; there is still so much to learn about the products of evolution. The underlying principle that characterises the shape and quality of life isn't DNA itself, but the transformation process that happens at the biomolecular level. If evolution can be performed on any genome, then why is DNA so special? 

It isn't. DNA is heavily optimised, but all life is not limited to this particular protein; it is just what formed first. This sentiment created the perfect segway for Francis Crick, who after his discoveries in molecular biology, switched to what was, in his words, the most vital study of all: consciousness.

Both evolution and consciousness are by-products of physical machinery that permit powerful emergent behaviours. It is this meshing of neuron frequencies, akin to the tones from individual instruments producing the rich and complex sounds of an orchastra. In other words, they are independent of their substrate, and thus entirely unique concepts.

What other substrate independence exists? 

For one, waves are substrate-independent; their speed, length, frequency, intensity, and all behaviour related to their identity can be calculated without the knowledge of what matter the wave is passing through -- by use of Schrodinger's wave function.

The basic tenets of computation are also medium agnostic; the capacity to read and write to memory, perform conditional branching, basic arithmetic, and recursion, are all that is needed for a system to be Turing complete (Turing, 1950). This can be distilled into a minimal set of commands, used by the Brainfuck programming language (>, <, +, -, [, ], ., and ,). These operations allow the system to perform universal computation, meaning it can execute any computation given sufficient time and resources, regardless of the physical substrate. [[2]](#ref-2)

With this in mind, we may proceed to characterise consciousness as the sum of parallel computations, where each computation is an approximation of abstractions which exist beyond our comprehension. For humans, inputs are received through a set of sensors that detect wavelengths of light, vibrations in the air, odorants in the air, dissolved chemicals on the tongue, and mechanical deformation of the skin. Cranial nerves then transmit these via electrical impulse to the brain, where a transformation process occurs and applies existing action potential to the inputs to interpret them. 

A larger and more open mind would be able to transform magnitudes more computations per second across a larger subspace of meaning. We can imagine ourselves as a rung half way up a ladder of possible minds; those below us have more constrained brains or cognitive systems, perhaps driven more by instinct and reaction, and less by learned experience. Low-rung entities may occupy micro simulations created by beings with greater cognitive bounds, and vice versa for those above us. This is why substrate independence gives credence to the simulation hypothesis. 

The extent to which in-sim characters could know that they live in a simulation would depend on the design of their environment. Evolution in our physics sandbox has granted humans the ability to ponder this question, but we may not have the facilities to answer it. A loss landscape

But this isn't entirely off the books. A well-engineered simulation would have monotonic consistency across all areas; the basic boundaries would not be exploitable by any in-sim character beyond its purpose of construction. In a sense, no glitches would exist. 







By this logic, humans have the capability to invent their own superiors simply by building more unbounded, better generalisers. Technology that can self-improve during its lifetime has a signficant advantage over humans, who are yet to augment the mind with neurons or transfer ourselves onto microchips and extend ourselves digitally. 





Another such phenomena is the conscious experience. A conscious character in a future computer game will have no way of knowing whether it is running on a desktop, tablet of phone; given their interface for reality is built out of matter, they cannot detect the architecture on which they run without drawing conclusions from their environment, in exactly the same way we cannot detect our own synapses, and only know about their exist by conducting scientific experiments on our environment. This is provable not by any formula (yet), but instead by one's own logic. [[3]](#ref-3)

These 'substrate-independent phenomena' are objectively fundamental to nature itself; the identity of waves, computations, and consciousness, are all definable without needing knowledge of the matter they exist in. 

For example, if two programmers are jointly hunting a bug in their code, they are probably not discussing the computational architecture, but the software and the outcome of their button-inputs. The computations behind the code could be done with integrated circuits, vacuum tubes, relays, or electromechanical boards and the programmers wouldn't even know without opening it up.

#### III. Why Substrate-Independence is a Big Deal For Us 

What we are faced with (in plain English) is that the conscious experience does not arise from any particular arrangement of atoms, but from the dynamic process of their interaction. By nature of being substrate-independent, the specific makeup of proteins, enzymes, and cells in our body are not essential to our experience, and their behaviour can be emulated through any matter capable of facilitating this above-mentioned dynamic process of interaction.  

After the discovery of DNA, deciphering what it is that makes us human has been relatively straightforward: a focus on sequencing the human genome. There exists no such discovery for consciousness. Unfortunately, unlike waves and computations, exactly how this process of interaction works is still largely unknowable. This is partly because we lack an understanding of how to critically analyse it; progress is being made, but in an anarchy of methods. Consciousness is still a 'suitcase word', along with it cousins intelligence, thinking, cognitive, and emotion. [[5]](#ref-5)

However, there is light: the sheer fact that consciousness is substrate-independent means a number of significant things. 

	First, that it is possible that there are many forms of consciousness. 

If a conscious human mind is merely a complex system of electrochemical reactions and a conscious algorithm is merely a complex system of electrical current, then a complex system of kinetically charged particles, such as a thundercloud, could also be conscious. 

On a larger scale, the biosphere is a complex, regulating system of energy so complex that it is teeming with conscious agents. Who is to say that the biosphere itself is not conscious? Arguably, Earth has a metabolism, a biosphere that self-repairs, and an ability to shed itself in the form of human astronauts, rocket payloads and debris. Those three components fit the definition of life we used so convincingly before. Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis is still of huge contention 50 years later. [[6]](#ref-6)

Pushing scale to the limit, stars, solar systems, and galaxy clusters are all vastly more complex systems arbitrarily, and thus too could theoretically be waking. To prove this theory wrong, we will need to determine what it is exactly that guarantees consciousness and what prevents it. 

	Second, it is crucial that humans expand our own minds. 

- Enchancedments to cognitive abilities could be implemented digitally, leading to superintelligence.




Unlike life, which is either alive or dead, consciousness is malleable; it can be made more present or less present and yet still occur. The existence of brain implants prove that by biologically adding new sources of information into our cortex, the dynamic process of interaction can absorb the inputs and make them part of our experience. This is possibly the most exciting discovery ever.

The human brain receives 11 million input bits per second. 10 million of those are visual. What would it be like to have new types of inputs from our eyes? Implants could enable us to read x-rays, radio waves, and microwaves. Implants could enhance the resolution of our vision until we could see any object's molecular arrangement or disturbances in gas particles. By understanding the parameters of our conscious experience, we can change them like dials in the settings menu, enhancing our reality.

Equally, we can manipulate the surface on which the 'consciousness interaction' is maintained by implanting inorganic matter to the cortex, thus extending the lifetime of our minds indefinitely. 

The human brain is the most complex object in the universe. By understanding how it works, we can make it infinitely more complex and infinitely more effective at doing our bidding. And as we expand the human biological arena and lose our archaic subservience to the forces that once determined our survival, what our bidding is exactly will inevitably change.
