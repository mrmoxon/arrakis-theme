  <p>Some things I believe:</p>

  <ul class="bullets beliefs">

    <li>At the level of civilisation
      <ul>
        <li>universe is hyper young, life on Earth an <a href="https://grabbyaliens.com/" class="no-underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlier</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1744179910347039080?lang=en" class="no-underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">democratising</a> intelligence will supercharge <a href="https://www.e-ir.info/2018/01/11/review-four-futures-life-after-capitalism/#:~:text=One%20can%20have%20abundance%20with,the%20eternal%20present%20of%20capitalism" class="no-underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abundance</a> and quality of life</li>
        <li>sustained flourishing of life is a moral responsibility of intelligence</li>
        <li>transformers will provide a stable and scalable paradigm for an early AGI by '28</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>The alignment problem defines the core behaviour of society
      <ul>
        <li>it is the triple point of "paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology<a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00016553" class="no-underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"</a></li>
        <li>pure technology is undesirable, as it regenerates faster than humans ever will</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Lessons from economics:
        <ul>
            <li>EMH is weak at best, all opportunities emerge in the gaps of market rationality</li>
            <li>the fate of billions is steered overwhelmingly by the work of a few</li>
            <li>consolidations of market power are dangerous and wasteful, but optimal for investors</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Lessons from research:
        <ul>
            <li>ultimate promise of LLMs is agents, ultimate promise of agents is automatic science</li>
            <li>moving to agent(s) improves prompting from <em>"write me an essay"</em> to <em>"run my company"</em> or <em>"build me a dyson syphere"</em></li>
            <li>digital platforms maximise hyperstimuli and addiction, by choice or by nature. reels/tiktok are 0.5-d <a href="https://twitter.com/oscarmoxon/status/1722378053924397277" class="no-underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wireheading</a></li>         
            <li>with LLMs we tread closer to the realm of natural abstraction - next stop: telepathy</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Some other thoughts:
        <ul>
            <li>innovation and agility thrive in small, focused groups working fast</li>
            <li>progress is rate limited by our ability to ask more meaningful questions - effective leaders are moral philosophers</li>
            <li>all people have a common <a href="/leverage" class="link">thread</a> that connects the major decisions they make</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
